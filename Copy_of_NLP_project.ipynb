shooting at emanuel church in charleston south carolina police departments across the country are connecting first responders with group to help them cope with trauma by mindy charleston s c when police chief gregory mullen started getting calls about potential at the emanuel church downtown he knew the first officers on the scene might need some extra help not or more but help coping with what he suspected would be horrific scene and he was right in barely six minutes on the night of june 17 2015 nine people at bible study at one of america’s oldest african american churches were murdered when young white man opened fire spewing racial epithets and 77 hollow point bullets eight victims died on the spot one died later in the hospital to counsel the first responders mullen called in cops who had experience with tough crime scenes some of those group were from virginia and had responded to the slaughter of 32 students and teachers at virginia tech in 2007 for decades police have kept silent about the toll trauma takes on them their families and their careers one result according to researchers is that they have higher suicide rates than the general population to change that police departments across the country are turning to nonprofit or state funded programs that help cops cope by connecting them to their peers and to mental health professionals “there’s much greater awareness of the effects of exposure to traumatic events in just the past five years said james baker director with the international association of chiefs of police many of the nonprofit programs are based on the law enforcement assistance program leap that began in south carolina 20 years ago eric presbyterian pastor launched the program with federal grant and now runs it in partnership with the state police state taxpayers can check box to contribute on their income tax forms and the nonprofit raises additional money from supporters and his peer support cops arrived less than 48 hours after the shooting at the church known as mother emanuel “we did some psychological first aid said later some of the responders attended three day seminar where they talked in both large and small groups of officers who’ve gone through trauma too programs like leap also offer professional mental health counseling teach techniques to dispel lingering memories and even provide to relieve tension arkansas georgia north carolina ohio texas and virginia have similar programs and kentucky is creating one in florida police departments in miami dade and counties are leaders in providing strong psychological support for officers baker said not single charleston officer has retired early or quit the force as result of the emanuel church shooting according to mullen he credits the sessions put on by south carolina’s leap program “a really important part of law enforcement is making sure you keep your people mentally physically emotionally and spiritually fit so they can do the work they are meant to do mullen said cops typically don’t talk about “the horrible things that one human being does to another said gregg psychiatrist who works with the police assistance groups in georgia north carolina and south carolina “there’s fear of what it will do to them on the job if they open up they worry going to know will it cost me promotion ” former agent with the naval criminal investigative service said the military’s increasing openness to helping service members cope with trauma is starting to spread to police departments but many police officers are still reluctant to open up “the ethos of policing is ‘we’re super people and we can’t be weak we’re not bunch of ” said john research professor at the state university of new york at buffalo who studies police health “what they forget is that they’re human ” between and 19 percent of america’s cops suffer from post traumatic stress disorder although those numbers may be low because police don’t readily report their emotional health according to and police are much more likely to commit suicide he said police have 69 percent higher risk of suicide than the average worker and detectives have an 82 percent higher risk according to analysis of data from the centers for disease control and prevention the cumulative effect of seeing mayhem over years makes cops more vulnerable to heart disease and diabetes too according to research “it’s the classic example of mind affecting body he said cops also are working in highly charged political atmosphere now with criticism of police shootings of unarmed people he said “i relate it to the vietnam war where vets were spat on and called killers ” said “it’s demoralizing ” cops also are working in highly charged political atmosphere now with criticism of police shootings of unarmed people he said the back was deputy sheriff in county virginia in 2005 when he got the call that an 8 year old girl had been hit by driver as she was crossing the street it was his daughter isabella though he’d been in the army and been cop for two decades the loss hit him hard “i started drinking heavily fell into alcohol and had thoughts of suicide said back 51 who is now deputy sheriff in charles city virginia his brother capt aaron back of the north carolina state highway patrol hooked his brother up with the leap program in south carolina and took him there for three day session “my brother fought me all the way he didn’t want to go no one would understand aaron said the program was so successful for his brother that aaron helped start leap program in north carolina in 2012 honestly it saved my life back said when cops show up for three day seminar on dealing with trauma they all have that reluctant “what have gotten myself look said rita watkins executive director of the law enforcement management institute in texas which has been running trauma sessions for five years at the beginning of typical session at many of these programs officers and sometimes their spouses sit around big table with peer group cops and mental health professionals the officers tell their stories sometimes for the first time everything is confidential their police chiefs won’t hear about what is said in the sessions “it’s gut wrenching said watkins “there’s lot of emotion that first day we share so much that the day is long ” on the second day the participating officers break into small groups then meet one on one with health professional or peer group cop and maybe get massage “these people are carrying so much physical stress and they don’t even realize it watkins said then they participate in technique to ease symptoms of trauma called eye movement desensitization and it’s an internationally known mode of treatment that combines talk therapy with rapid eye movement like you experience in deep sleep people dealing with trauma can’t get the images of the violence they’ve seen out of their minds “it’s like 60 inch color tv in front of your face all day long said lt steve click of the ohio state highway patrol who directs the ohio program after training he said “it’s 20 inch black and white in the corner somewhere ” people dealing with trauma can’t get the images of the violence they’ve seen out of their minds karen lansing who’s known as the is an expert on and has treated hundreds of police and u s military personnel who suffer from ptsd and other forms of trauma lansing was the first to study brain images and trauma in police she says it’s tough to break through the that first responders and military people have when she does an session she asks officers to close their eyes and recall the traumatic event and focus on every thought feeling physical reaction and emotion they experienced lansing and the officer break the episode into minute by minute segments and discuss them over and over “it’s clinically controlled flashback she said “we’re physical memory what they tasted in their mouth like the taste of metal which is really adrenaline what they actually felt as the bullet entered what were the sounds around them lansing said “we do it again and again and again until we neutralize these bombs ” \n",

            "Review: extremists and alike have attempted to paint violent factions within islam as the true expression of the faith but new study gives credence to what countless muslim leaders activists and scholars have argued that groups like the self proclaimed islamic state are muslim in name alone group of german scholars at the universities of and analyzed whatsapp messages found on phone seized by police following terrorist attack in the spring of 2016 the messages were exchanged among 12 young men involved in the attack the attack itself was not identified in the report noted that the timeframe suggested it may have been bombing at sikh temple in carried out in april of that year by group of german teens with reported links to islamic extremism researchers conducting the study said the young men’s conversations demonstrated little understanding of their professed faith and that the group constructed to suit their purposes dziri researcher at the university of and co author on the report examined the messages from an islamic studies perspective and concluded “the group had no basic knowledge about islam ” the scholars published their study as book exploring the youth scene in germany according to the amazon referencing an strain of islam with which the young men were allegedly affiliated the brookings institute defines as “the idea that the most authentic and true islam is found in the lived example of the early righteous generations of muslims known as the who were closest in both time and proximity to the prophet muhammad ” the movement has historically been and nonviolent wrote researcher mohammed in column on the new york times but brookings notes that smaller offshoot faction called jihadists do promote violence as and include groups like isis and al qaeda as one case study the amazon highlights the whatsapp offer into the group internal dynamics of young and their processes ” one thing that stood out dziri said in an email to huffpost was the extent to which the men had distanced themselves from local mosques and seemed confused about things as simple as how to go about conducting friday prayers at one point in the exchange young man asked if the faith permits cheating in school the researcher said “the answer was that it is allowed to do everything with the and since nearly all other people are you can do everything with everyone dziri said another man admitted in the messages he didn’t have copy of the quran islam’s holy text and the others agreed that they needed to purchase one dr professor at the university of and one of the study’s co authors said it was that the discussion about obtaining quran occurred well after the group had been established “all religious conversations conducted up to this time were only content that has been learned from and rumors told huffpost when the group’s self appointed leader called for meeting one participant that he didn’t have any islamic clothing the leader responded “you can also wear or something like that if you want can loan you something for the day ” the report is just case study from one group of individuals and its conclusions might not apply in all circumstances but it echoes the conclusions of many muslim scholars and activists who see little resemblance to their religion in such militant groups and dziri also noted that the 12 men involved in the whatsapp chat appeared to have received little and isolated themselves from other muslims in their community “one of the main points for us is that these young radicalized people come mostly from family which is remote from religion and they do not themselves in mosques dziri said “with profound knowledge of faith it would be impossible or at least considerably more difficult to in that way ” \n",

            "Review: after their efforts to approve replacement for the affordable care act aca went down to defeat again the republicans came up with new strategy on health care as donald trump put it they are going to “let obamacare fail ” the idea appears to let the health care exchanges which are the centerpiece of the aca fall apart as more insurers leave then when there are few exchanges operating with any substantial level of competition trump and the republicans will sail in with some version of the plans that have collapsed in the last five months they will now have the compelling argument that their replacement plan is better than nothing since there will be little or nothing left of the health care exchanges while it is possible that this strategy could work there is really important point that often gets left out of the picture the exchanges are not dying in fact according to experts who study this issue and aren’t on donald trump’s payroll the exchanges are actually doing quite well the assessment of the congressional budget office the kaiser family foundation and others is that the health care exchanges have largely stabilized and insurers are now able to operate in other words the people who don’t have something to gain by lying about the health of obamacare say that the program is actually working predictably the people who do get paid by the white house pronounce such assessments as “fake news ” the basic point is simple one contrary to the claims of trump and congressional republicans the exchanges are not in death spiral are increasing that is the wrong direction for the the obamacare story of course many people have heard about all of the counties with little or no competition in their exchanges more than counties only have single insurer in their exchanges and some don’t have any that is indeed bad news but the lack of competition in the exchanges is overwhelming problem for people who live in states controlled by republicans while more than 20 percent of the people who live in states with republican governors only have one insurer in their exchange this is the case for less than 2 0 percent of the people who live in states with democratic governors this figure excludes north carolina where democratic governor just took over in january many states with republican governors did not expand medicaid this expansion helped the exchanges since it pulled out many of the less healthy people from the patient pools in the exchange these governors also were not aggressive in promoting the exchanges as result fewer healthy people signed up for insurance making the exchange population less healthy than in states controlled by democrats trying to make the aca work the result is that republicans can now happily boast about their success in undermining the insurance market in much of the country trump is apparently prepared to build on this success and see if he can undermine the exchanges even in the states controlled by democrats and he does have tools to do it the first tool is the the government makes to insurers for covering out of pocket costs for low income people if insurers did not cover these expenses insurance would be unaffordable for many low income people and the insurers won’t cover the costs if the government is not picking up the tab even more importantly trump could refuse to enforce the individual mandate this is an essential part of the system since insurers are prohibited from discriminating against people based on their health as result healthy person could decide to go years without insurance and only start paying premiums if they develop serious illness in this situation the insurance pool ends up being less healthy and more costly for insurers this is sure path to death spiral in this scenario insurers raise rates because of their less healthy pool the higher rates discourage healthier people from getting insurance further worsening the health of the average insure this cycle will continue until the pool only includes the least healthy and most expensive patients through these and other mechanisms president trump certainly is capable of killing obamacare but let’s not play games here trump is not talking about letting the patient die he is talking about murder trump and the republicans are not discussing whether they should let obamacare die they are plotting to kill it \n",

arriving for an official dinner in damascus late on feb 25 2010 since the start of the syrian conflict lebanon’s government has officially adopted policy of toward the war next door however now some lebanese political parties and organizations allied with bashar al assad seem to be trying to overthrow the policy beirut president bashar al assad’s allies in lebanon have continued to challenge muddled policy of disengagement with the syrian state so far without any repercussions lebanon’s official policy toward the war next door is ” however earlier this month the country’s preeminent armed lebanese political group hezbollah coordinated with damascus to organize the largest formal of refugees and fighters to syria since the start of the conflict ministers from three pro assad lebanese political groups also attended an international trade fair in the syrian capital last week in an open display of contempt for the policy this is not the first time that assad’s lebanese allies have ignored their government’s official position toward syria but the latest developments signal that they may be actively trying to upend the policy even if it has been largely symbolic “the policy is myth it’s not reality it’s nothing more than political slogan head of the beirut based institute for strategic affairs told syria deeply “right now we are in situation where we have multiple governments within one government with each minister choosing to have foreign policy of their own it’s complete chaos ” the flaws of when fighting broke out in syria lebanese political parties were split between those who were pro opposition and those who supported the government meanwhile the majority of arab states in the region severed ties with damascus publicly criticizing assad by 2012 lebanese political groups were as divided as the warring syrian factions themselves to protect his divided government from complete collapse and to maintain ties with the international community then prime minister adopted the so called policy the policy did not sever diplomatic or trade ties between the two countries but prevented the lebanese government from engaging with assad’s government in an official capacity it also meant that lebanon would not officially support assad or the syrian opposition political parties in lebanon however failed to fall in line hezbollah made its support for the syrian government abundantly clear and over the following six years the group emerged as one of the most powerful paramilitary forces fighting in syria on behalf of assad on the other hand lebanon’s largest sunni bloc and primary rival the future movement openly sided with the syrian opposition and supported international calls to overthrow the government in damascus the rift in the government over ties with syria deepened last week when ministers affiliated with hezbollah the shiite amal movement and the christian movement attended the damascus international fair trade exhibition the syrian government touted as its of economic victory ” the visit was one of the most publicized by lebanese ministerial delegation since the start of the conflict it was also highly controversial since it was not sanctioned by the state instead lebanon’s prime minister said any minister who went to syria was doing so in personal rather than official capacity but the ministers publicly contradicted the official statement “we are here in our official ministerial capacities and we congratulate the syrian leadership for their victory over terrorism industry minister and hezbollah official hussein hajj hassan said after meeting with the syrian prime minister on thursday according to lebanon’s state run national news agency minister of public works and transportation youssef followed suit in comments reported by the “why should we hide behind our fingers the movement minister asked “when we as ministers arrive at the syrian border will they say we are no longer ministers will they say we are just ordinary people visiting the trade fair a larger trend according to associate professor of political science at the lebanese american university the contradictory narratives illustrate trend in lebanese foreign policy “my impression is that in lebanon you rarely ever have coherent foreign policy because of the structure of the state different have different foreign policies said “so what we are seeing today is not something that is extraordinary in lebanese politics we have weak state and strong non state actors ” another example of this he said was the evacuation of thousands of syrian refugees militants and their families from lebanon to syria earlier this month although lebanon’s prime minister said his government would coordinate refugee transfers only with the u n hezbollah negotiated the largest formal of syrian refugees and fighters since the start of the war without the official involvement of the lebanese government or international humanitarian agencies the first population transfer saw thousands of refugees al qaida linked militants and their families bused from lebanese border town to the rebel held province of idlib on august less than two weeks later hezbollah reached an agreement with free syrian army affiliate that saw thousands more refugees fighters and their families transferred to the syrian town of al ward and rebel held positions in the eastern region what’s more hezbollah coordinated the transfer with state run lebanese security agencies such as lebanese general security but without official state involvement deliberate balancing act who has written extensively on lebanon’s relationship with syria said the lebanese government was intentionally allowing non state actors to manage relations with damascus “to think you can ignore what is happening on the other side of the border is impossible the government can’t do it so it will be up to non state actors to get involved he said “the government is intentionally leaving it to non state actors to handle relations with syria to balance between regional powers and their internal ” by allowing hezbollah to handle relations with syria the lebanese government can still claim degree of distance from syria and in turn maneuver between the competing demands of regional powers such as saudi arabia and iran which both support rival groups within the cabinet the government recipient of significant u s military aid can also continue to pose as natural arab ally of assad’s opponents in washington as evidenced by last month’s meeting between the lebanese prime minister and u s president donald trump this balancing act may be sustainable for the time being but looking forward lebanon will eventually have to confront the issue of future ties with syria especially if assad’s allies in lebanon keep pushing the country toward normalizing ties with damascus however according to future ties between lebanon and syria will not be shaped by the two countries themselves but will instead be defined by broader agreement between regional and international powers “for the future we have to remember that lebanon’s foreign policy is consequence of the geopolitical balance of power lebanon is not of geopolitics it is receiver ” this article originally appeared on syria deeply and you can find the original here for

becoming more widely available to expectant parents cell free dna testing mayo medical laboratories recently launched blood test to screen for the most common disorders diagnosed in pregnancy such as down syndrome it’s known as cell free dna test it screens the mother’s blood that contains dna from the baby looking for genetic disorders in the fetus the new test generally has higher detection rate and fewer false positives than traditional screening tests to this new test mothers had the option of traditional first trimester screening which is blood test and ultrasound or second trimester screening which is blood test in general the cell free dna blood test can be used in place of the traditional first and second trimester screening explains dr wick it is important to remember that the cell free dna testing is screening test and abnormal results should be followed up with additional testing the out of pocket cost for the new blood test varies depending on insurance coverage and the specific laboratory performing the testing general estimate is approximately 350 results are usually ready within one week expanded carrier screening in the past couples had genetic screening based on family history of genetic disorder or if they were part of an ethnic group at risk for certain inherited diseases previous tests only screened for small defined group of genetic disorders those tests didn’t help couples who were uncertain of their ethnic heritage plus the tests were very limited in scope “it’s an exciting time in perinatal testing dna sequencing and molecular technology has improved and become more cost effective these tests are important for family planning prior to pregnancy as well as planning for the care of child who is found to have genetic disorder during pregnancy dr wick now couples may choose more comprehensive test that looks for 100 or more genetic disorders it’s called expanded carrier screening this test is done with blood sample from each prospective parent carrier screening looks at multiple genes associated with genetic diseases most of the disorders included on an expanded carrier screen are inherited in an manner this means that the parents are carriers of the disorder with one normal copy of the gene and one abnormal copy of the gene carriers of an disorder do not typically have signs or symptoms of the disease child is affected with an disorder when he or she one abnormal copy of the gene from mom and one abnormal copy of the gene from dad approximately 5 of couples who undergo expanded carrier screening are found
