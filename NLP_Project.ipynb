            "Review: can do this just 20 minutes just sit still my shoulder stop thinking about it my foot is falling asleep almost numb the numbness is always the opening act for the pins and needles that would be good name for band the pins and needles and here they come singing right up my leg ve never been able to decide whether moving helps them go away faster or just makes it worse think should go get more yogurt cups for the girls at trader joe oh and need more apples too okay my shoulder really now ve got to itch it just breathe little longer speaking of how long has it been don look don do it peel my upper lid from my lower lid just enough so no one will notice even though the only living creature nearby is outside my door and doubt he can see past his beak really it only been two minutes who am meditating for why would care if someone sees me open my eyes feel can even sit for two minutes without full chorus of complaints and to dos this is how it used to be for 10 years struggled my way through every meditation had the desire and the discipline yet couldn seem to be anywhere but elsewhere few years ago began asking the question why why do meditate and why can i meditate from the why came the how how do meditate meditation is science the science of understanding the pathways of the brain and how they react to different situations experiences and through this understanding we can learn how to respond to these reactions and train the brain to focus before we can have purposeful meditation and yoga practice we must first become scientist in the physics of the practice it is impossible to in stillness for any amount of time without knowing how our brain functions until we this knowledge sitting is ineffective waste of time and detrimental to our well being due to the unnecessary pressure and expectation that breeds from our practice and all is coming these are the wise words of the late the master of ashtanga agree as long as there is method to the practice and guidance of the method practice may bring mastery that mimics perfection but practice also creates suffering if one does not know what they are doing and why they are doing it attempting to sit in meditation without learned technique is comparable to placing 2 year old on the floor of the nyse and expecting him to navigate the system on his own while conducting the trades for the day chaos amidst chaos chaos causes more chaos my favorite description of enlightenment is enlightenment is learning not to make more struggle of the existing struggle in this situation not making more struggle would be grooming and teaching person how to traverse the trading floor with grace discerning the viable trades within the noise and creating profit meditation is the same we learn how the brain operates cultivating the tools to manage it before we sit down to listen to it the profit to an educated is life with an abundance of efficiency and intention we respond more and react less because we the mind have learned how to direct the brain as it keeps the trading floor open all day every day the brain is the nyse the mind is the trader the brain and the mind are two separate parts as are the spirit and the soul in order for them to work they must be studied separately understood individually and then connected together before we can be present in stillness we may want to learn how to be present in action the other day woman approached me and in one stressed breath she asked my friend told me you are yoga teacher and ve always wanted to meditate and be present and just want to learn how how can meditate asked you probably already do and you don even know it what do you love to do that you her face relaxed and she replied quietly like to run can hear myself breathe feel my feet and notice my surroundings so you see you already meditate just do it more in other of your life turn any chore or repetitive action into sensory and see if you can separate each sense from the other for example when vacuum am only pay attention to the feel of the handle in my hand the and as turn it on how the vacuum as it across crumb on the carpet and the sound of the crumb as it is chewed inside the am completely there in the experience hearing feeling seeing am my brain on task as my mind remains concentrated in the experience extract myself from my surroundings so that may be in it being in it is being present her response began with sigh of relief oh my gosh can totally do that yes you can encouraged the how to begins with attention paying attention and educating ourselves about the mechanics of the brain that it before we can sit still and meditate like in cave we need to learn how within ourselves in the active moment without thinking of the next action this is presence being present and think it may even be little something they like to call enlightenment \n",
