3,Oil price rises above $70 after attacks on Saudi oil facilities,https://www.ft.com/content/3a094943-5663-477f-96d9-13f230880b7b,https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3b6e6508-65db-4892-bd60-e42a2831bcad.jpg?source=next&fit=scale-down&compression=best&width=210,"Oil prices briefly rose above $70 a barrel for the first time in 14 months after Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, said its energy facilities had been attacked on Sunday, targeting “the security and stability” of global supplies.

A drone attack from the sea on a petroleum storage tank at Ras Tanura, one of the largest oil shipping ports in the world, took place on Sunday morning, the kingdom said.

In the evening, shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell in Dhahran, where state oil company Saudi Aramco has its headquarters and near where thousands of employees and their families live.

While Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy said the attacks “did not result in any injury or loss of life or property”, and a person familiar with the matter said no production had been affected, the attacks have still unsettled oil markets that have rebounded strongly in recent months.

Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose as much as 2.9 per cent to $71.38 a barrel on Monday morning in Asia while West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, rose by a similar amount to a high of $67.98 a barrel. Both commodities pulled back later on Monday, with Brent slipping to $68.77 and WTI inching lower to $65.49.

Yemen’s Iran-allied Houthi fighters claimed responsibility for the attacks and said they had also focused on military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan.

A Houthi military spokesperson said the group had fired 14 bomb-laden drones and eight ballistic missiles in a “wide operation in the heart of Saudi Arabia”.

Amrita Sen at Energy Aspects emphasised that while a direct hit on oil supplies appeared to have been avoided, the threat to the market would still be taken seriously by oil traders.



“The oil price was already on a strong footing after Saudi Arabia and Opec’s decision last week to keep restricting production,” she said.



Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, had risen close to $70 a barrel after the cartel and allies outside the group, including Russia, decided not to unleash a flood of crude on to the market.



Amid uncertainty about the oil market outlook as the coronavirus crisis continues to have an impact on crude demand, the group decided against raising production by 1.5m barrels a day from April.



Given the supply curbs, while the kingdom has the extra production capacity to tap into, “geopolitical threats to supply will add a premium to the price”, Sen added.



The kingdom’s state media outlet said earlier in the day that the Saudi-led military coalition confronting the Houthis had intercepted missiles and drones aimed at “civilian targets” without indicating their location.

The Eastern Province, where Dhahran is located, is where much of Saudi Aramco’s oil facilities are located. The attack is the most severe since September 2019.



At that time the kingdom was rocked by missile and drone fire that hit an important processing facility and two oilfields, temporarily shutting off more than half of the country’s crude output.



The Houthis have ramped up assaults on Saudi Arabia through airborne attacks and explosive-laden boats and mines in the Red Sea, laying bare the vulnerability of the country’s energy infrastructure despite the kingdom’s production prowess and its hold over the oil market.



“The frequency of these attacks is rising, even if the impact on energy infrastructure appears limited,” said Bill Farren-Price, a director at research company Enverus. “We know the capacity to cause serious damage exists, so this will boost the risk premium for oil.”

25,Libyan women want progress after appointment of first female foreign minister,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-libya-government-women/libyan-women-want-progress-after-appointment-of-first-female-foreign-minister-idUSKBN2B32KE,,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s first woman foreign minister, Najla el-Mangoush, will be sworn in next week as part of a new unity government, a rare female voice at the top table whose appointment many Libyan women welcomed on Thursday.

Mangoush, a lawyer who had a role in the transitional council that briefly governed Libya after its 2011 uprising, will be joined by four other women in the cabinet, including Halima Abdulrahman as justice minister.

“I think this is a win for all of us women in Libya. I hope it’s a first step to going further: a woman reaching head of government,” said Afia Mohammed, 34, a pastry maker in Tripoli, adding it would encourage more women to enter politics.

Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibeh’s interim government emerged through a United Nations talks process and is mandated to unify Libya’s divided state institutions and oversee national elections in December.

The 75 Libyan delegates selected by the U.N. to take part in those talks laid out a commitment for the new government to include women in 30% of senior government roles, including in top cabinet posts.

Women represent only 15% of the posts in Dbeibeh’s cabinet but the proportion will rise when deputy ministers are appointed, he has said.

Elham Saudi, a lawyer and talks delegate, said: “It’s a stepping stone towards fuller representation.”

She said the quota was a result of women in the forum being “absolutely relentless on this point” despite having big differences on other political issues.

As the first meeting took place in Tunis, where Saudi said women delegates faced a barrage of sexist online abuse, a women’s rights lawyer, Hanan al-Barassi, was shot dead on a busy Benghazi street.

When the Libyan state crumbled after 2011 and myriad warring factions seized territory, women suffered a wave of violence and those in official positions were nearly all men - until now.

“This will give an opportunity for other women to join the work in sovereign positions. The five ministers will be role models,” said Lamees BenSaad, a women’s rights activist and another member of the U.N. talks forum. “We have been fighting a long time for this gain.”

Opposition to women having a big public role is not only held by men. Tahani Qarouq, who makes wedding delicacies in Tripoli, said she did not agree with women running cabinet ministries or state institutions.

But Hanan Malouda, selling beauty products in the market, said women in government would be good for Libya. “Hopefully they will have more compassion for us,” she said."
26,Pakistan blocks social media app TikTok over indecency complaint,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-socialmedia-tiktok/pakistan-blocks-social-media-app-tiktok-over-indecency-complaint-idUSKBN2B329C,,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Thursday blocked the popular social media app TikTok after a court order over a complaint that it ran indecent content, a spokesman for the country’s telecoms regulator said.

“The court has asked PTA to block access to TikTok,” Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) spokesman Khurram Mehran told Reuters, adding that the authority would comply with the order.

A high court in the northwestern city of Peshawar said it ordered the ban after a private complainant said the social media app was spreading indecent content, said Jehanzeb Mehsud, a lawyer who represented the PTA.

The service providers have been directed to immediately block access to TikTok, the regulator said in a statement.

The app stopped working within an hour of the direction.

A TikTok representative in Pakistan said strong safeguards were in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform.

“In Pakistan, we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines,” the representative said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”

Muslim-majority Pakistan had banned the app in October, but restored it within 10 days after the company vowed to block all accounts involved in spreading “obscenity and immorality.”

The telecom regulator said the social media company had agreed to moderate accounts in accordance with local laws.

TikTok has been one of the most-downloaded apps in the South Asian nation behind WhatsApp and Facebook.

TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has become hugely popular in a short period of time, by encouraging young users to post brief videos.

But the app has been mired in controversy in a number of countries, with authorities raising privacy concerns and security fears due to its links with China.

TikTok has denied that its ties to China pose a security concern in other countries."

FILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu adjusts his mask during a news conference after his meeting with the Israeli citizen no. 5,000,000 to get the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 8, 2021. Miriam Alster/Pool via REUTERS

A high-profile first visit to Abu Dhabi in the build-up to an Israeli election on March 23 would have allowed Netanyahu to put his imprimatur on Israel-UAE normalisation ties that were formalised last year.

A hold-up in permission for Netanyahu’s plane to overfly Jordan “apparently” stemmed from the cancellation of a visit by Jordanian Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah to Jerusalem’s Al Aqsa mosque compound on Wednesday over a dispute regarding security arrangements at the site, according to a statement issued by Netanyahu’s office.

Permission eventually came through but too late for Netanyahu’s itinerary, which included meeting his visiting Hungarian and Czech counterparts back in Jerusalem later on Thursday, the statement said.

The UAE had not formally confirmed the planned visit, which leaked to Israeli media on Wednesday.

Netanyahu later said that he and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan had since spoken, and had agreed to reschedule and to cooperate in the fight against the coronavirus and on huge investment projects.

The UAE, Netanyahu told a news conference, intended “to invest a gigantic sum of $10 billion...in various projects...and we are already discussing these specific projects.”

Netanyahu did not elaborate on the nature of such projects or mention a timetable for their funding and implementation.

He said he would visit the UAE “very soon” and that Israel and the Gulf state wanted to create a “green passport” between the two countries, citing a programme to ease passage for those who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus.

Commenting on the friction with Jordan, Netanyahu said there had been a “misunderstanding, difficulties in coordinating (my) flights (to the UAE) because of an incident yesterday” related to the planned Jordanian visit to the Al Aqsa mosque.

“It took us a few hours to put things right...I can now fly over Jordan, but until this coordination was achieved, it was not possible to visit (the UAE) today,” he said.

Jordanian officials were not immediately available for comment on the overflight issue. But Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi confirmed the crown prince’s cancelled al Aqsa visit - which would have been the first there by Jordan’s future king.

ISRAELI “RESTRICTIONS”

State TV quoted Safadi as saying Israeli authorities had tried to change a programme agreed with Amman in a manner that it deemed harmful to Palestinian and Muslim rights of worship.

“The crown prince did not want to allow Israel to impose restrictions on Muslims,” Safadi was quoted as saying.

Jordan’s ruling Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Al Aqsa compound, an icon of the Palestinian statehood struggle and the third holiest site in Islam. Israel, which made peace with Jordan in 1994, maintains security control around the site, which Jews revere as the vestige of their two ancient temples.

Jordan says Israel, which captured East Jerusalem, including the walled Old City where al Aqsa is located, in the 1967 Middle East war, has no sovereign rights over the compound and has long chafed at organised visits there by religious Jews.

Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its capital and annexed its eastern sector after the 1967 conflict, in a move that has not won international recognition."

Mohammad Dahlan, who fell out with Abbas and was dismissed from the president’s Fatah party more than a decade ago, took credit for securing the shipment to Gaza from the UAE, where he lives in exile.

In a potential challenge to Abbas, Dahlan has announced plans to field a list of candidates he dubs “Fatah reformists” in a parliamentary election scheduled for May.

The vaccine shipment brought to 60,000 the number of Sputnik V doses that Dahlan has obtained for Palestinians since February, outpacing official Palestinian authorities.

Dahlan, in a statement, said the latest doses “aim to afford protection for our courageous medical teams and people with priority ... particularly the elderly and those suffering from certain (chronic) diseases”.

He said half of the new shipment would be allocated to Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Abbas’s Palestinian Authority has limited self-rule.

It was not immediately clear whether Abbas would accept the donation and if so whether Israel would allow the vaccines to be transferred from Hamas Islamist-run Gaza to the West Bank through its territory.

“God-willing it will be an effective medication and that we will get rid of the pandemic,” said Maha Addahouk after medics vaccinated her at a U.N.-run clinic in Gaza.

Gaza has registered more than 56,000 COVID-19 cases with 564 deaths among a population of two million.

The Palestinian Authority plans to cover 20% of Palestinians through the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme. But on Wednesday, the Palestinian health minister said COVAX shipments expected in March had been postponed until May.

Israel, a world leader in its vaccination rollout, has drawn international calls to do more to help Palestinians living in occupied territory fight the pandemic. It has begun vaccinating about 120,000 Palestinians with Israeli work permits.

Farid Mahdawi, the Palestinian Ambassador to China, told Voice of Palestine Radio on Thursday that 50,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, half of the doses pledged by Beijing, would arrive in the West Bank within days."

Attempts to refer atrocities in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague for prosecution have failed, Michelle Bachelet said.

Only one person has been convicted in a foreign court for crimes against humanity or war crimes in a conflict that has cost hundreds of thousands of lives, many of them civilians.

“It remains vital that national courts continue to conduct fair, public and transparent trials and reduce the accountability gap for such serious crimes,” Bachelet said in a statement.

Pro-democracy protests against President Bashar al-Assad’s authoritarian family rule erupted in March 2011 in southern Syria and were met by a crackdown. But they spread quickly across the country and developed into a multi-sided war that in addition to the numerous casualties has forced more than 11 million from their homes, around half the pre-war population.

Assad’s forces, backed by Iran and Russia, have recaptured many areas once held by rebel factions and Islamist militants, but the war grinds on in some corners of Syria.

It is thought that many suspected war criminals have relocated overseas.

A German court sentenced a former member of President Bashar al-Assad’s security services to 4-1/2 years in prison last month for abetting the torture of civilians, the first such verdict for crimes against humanity in the Syrian war.

Bachelet called the conviction “an important step forward on the path to justice”.

Paulo Pinheiro, chair of a team of U.N. war crimes investigators, denounced prevailing impunity.

“We commend the great courage and ingenuity of Syrian victims and activists, and the determination of some member states to bring cases where they can,” he told the Human Rights Council on Thursday.

Assad’s government has denied many previous U.N. accusations of war crimes and says it does not torture prisoners.

U.N. panel member Hanny Megally said it had been approached by 60 jurisdictions seeking information and it had provided information in about 300 ongoing cases."
30,Afghan leaders invited by Russia to meeting on struggling peace process,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-peaceplan-russia/afghan-leaders-invited-by-russia-to-meeting-on-struggling-peace-process-idUSKBN2B329V,,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan political leaders including former president Hamid Karzai are mulling whether to attend a meeting organised by Russia to jumpstart Afghanistan’s peace process as diplomacy by foreign powers including Washington ramps up.

Russia plans to hold a conference on Afghanistan in Moscow on March 18 and has invited several regional players. It comes at a crunch time for the peace process as a May 1 deadline for foreign troops to withdraw from Afghanistan looms and the United States reviews its plans.

Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and insurgent Taliban in Qatar’s capital Doha have struggled to make progress. Mohammed Naeem, a spokesman for the Taliban, told Reuters it had received an invitation from Moscow, but had not yet decided whether to attend or not.

A source close to the Taliban said on condition of anonymity that a team of around four-five members of the Islamist group’s political office in Doha would attend the conference.

Former president Karzai, his former vice-president Karim Khalili as well as former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar have received invitations, their spokespeople said. Only Khalili confirmed he would attend.

President Ashraf Ghani and top peace official and former presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah were also considering whether to join the conference, their offices said.

The summit comes at a sensitive time as Ghani faces pressure after U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad proposed plans for a transitional government during a regional visit last week, an option Ghani rejected in a fiery speech over the weekend saying only elections could determine the government.

Khalilzad is proposing a separate conference in Turkey in coming weeks, asking for the United Nations to run it.

Diplomatic sources say the United States, Pakistan and China have also been invited to attend on March 18. The U.S. State Department has said it has “nothing to confirm” on the matter.

A spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign ministry did not respond to request for comment.

A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry did not confirm or deny receiving an invitation, but said: “China is actively studying the multilateral meetings on Afghanistan proposed by Russia.”"

REUTERS/Mohammed Salem

GAZA (Reuters) - Three Palestinian fishermen who died in an offshore blast on Sunday had encountered an explosive-laden Israeli drone that had fallen into the sea and blew up in their nets, the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza said on Thursday.

An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment. At the time of the blast, the Israeli military had denied it had any involvement in the incident.

The incident came at a time when Palestinian militants have been test-firing rockets into the sea, and a Gaza-based human rights group, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, said on Sunday the fishing boat may have been hit by accident.

But Eyad Al-Bozom, the Gaza Interior Ministry’s spokesman, said no Palestinian rocket had hit the fishing boat, and that parts of an Israeli quadcopter drone that carried explosives were discovered in its nets. The drone had blown up as the fishermen were lifting their nets, killing all three.

Bozom said the drone had probably been in the water since an Israeli attack on a Palestinian naval craft on Feb. 22 off Gaza.

The Israeli military said at the time its forces noticed suspicious naval activity off Gaza’s shore and thwarted a “potential threat to Israeli naval vessels”, without elaborating on the weapons used.

The Israeli military rarely comments publicly on the use of explosives-carrying drones.

Hamas, an Islamist militant group, took control of Gaza in 2007, and the seaside strip, home to 2 million Palestinians, has since been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt, which cite security concerns for the measure."
32,Jordan says crown prince canceled visit to Jerusalem's al Aqsa mosque over security row with Israel,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jordan-israel-crown-prince/jordan-says-crown-prince-canceled-visit-to-jerusalems-al-aqsa-mosque-over-security-row-with-israel-idUSKBN2B321V,,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Thursday the kingdom’s crown prince cancelled a visit to Jerusalem’s al Aqsa mosque to prevent Israel from undermining his first such trip to the city’s holy sites.

Foreign Minister Ayman al Safadi confirmed the planned visit, which Israel earlier said had been scheduled for Wednesday but cancelled over a dispute regarding security arrangements at the site, which it did not specify.

Safadi said Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah had planned to join Palestinian worshippers during a service in the mosque, which is Islam’s third holiest site and located in Jerusalem’s walled Old City, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Jews revere the site as the vestige of their two ancient temples, and it has often been a flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian violence.

Safadi said Israel had changed the crown prince’s programme agreed with Amman and the move was seen as compromising the right of Palestinians and other Muslims to worship at the site.

“The Aqsa in its entirety is a place of worship for Muslims and Jordan won’t allow any interference in its affairs and Israel has no sovereignty over it,” Safadi said on state TV.

Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its “eternal and indivisible capital”. It annexed East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, after the 1967 conflict, in a move that has not won international recognition.

Jordan’s Hashemite ruling family is the custodian of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in East Jerusalem.

Israel recognised the Hashemite role as safekeepers of al-Aqsa as part of the two countries’ 1994 peace treaty, and maintains overall security control over the holy site.

Amman has long condemned what it says are Israeli efforts to restrict non-Jewish access to the 35-acre (14-hectare) compound, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.

Israel cites security concerns for restricting the access of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to the site and any limits it imposes on the number of Muslim worshippers allowed into the compound."

PARIS (Reuters) - France’s foreign minister said on Thursday time was running out to prevent Lebanon collapsing and that he could see no sign that the country’s politicians were doing what they could to save it.

France has spearheaded international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate from its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war by trying to use Paris’ historical influence to persuade squabbling politicians to adopt a reform roadmap and form a new government to unlock international aid.

“I would be tempted to qualify Lebanese politicians as guilty of not helping a country in danger,” Jean-Yves le Drian told a news conference in Paris.

“They all committed to act to create an inclusive government and committed to implementing indispensable reforms. That was seven months ago and nothing is moving. I think it’s not too late, but the delays are very small before collapse.

Prime minister-designate Saad al-Hariri is at loggerheads with President Michel Aoun and has been unable to form a new government since October.

Groups of protesters have been burning tyres daily to block roads since the Lebanese currency tumbled to a new lows, deepening popular anger over Lebanon’s financial collapse.

“It’s up to the Lebanese authorities to take their destiny in hand knowing that the international community is looking with concern,” Le Drian said. “There is still time to act today, but tomorrow will be too late.”"

“Today we launched a new trilateral consultation process,” Cavusoglu said after talks in Doha with Russian and Qatari foreign ministers. “Our goal is to discuss how we can contribute to efforts towards a lasting political solution in Syria.”

All three ministers emphasised in their meeting that the only solution to the conflict, in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced, was a political settlement in line with United Nations resolutions, he said.

Turkey and Qatar have backed fighters who sought to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Moscow provided military support which helped Assad seize back most of the country.

Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the three countries were not seeking to replace efforts which Turkey, Russia and Iran had jointly been making since 2017 to reduce fighting in Syria and discuss a political solution.

“I can only welcome Qatar’s desire to make its contribution to creating the conditions for overcoming the current tragic situation in Syria,” he said.

LESSENING SYRIANS’ SUFFERING

Qatari minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said they had also discussed mechanisms for delivering humanitarian aid across the whole of Syria, adding “there is a crucial need to lessen the suffering of the Syrians.”

He said the reasons for Syria’s suspension from the Arab League in 2011 remain, while Cavusoglu said recent international engagement with Assad’s government hindered efforts for a political solution by giving it more legitimacy.

In a joint statement after their talks, the ministers urged U.N. agencies and the World Health Organization to prioritise COVID-19 vaccinations inside Syria and to “enhance” efforts for delivering humanitarian aid.

They also stressed their commitment to preserving Syria’s independence and territorial integrity.

Cavusoglu said Turkey would host the next round of the talks."
35,Famine is returning to Yemen -- and a Saudi fuel blockade stands to make it worse,https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/10/middleeast/yemen-famine-saudi-fuel-intl/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210309154308-03-yemen-cnn-exlarge-tease.jpg,"Hodeidah, Yemen (CNN) When 10-month-old Hassan Ali arrived at the hospital, doctors were hopeful they could save him. So many children in northern Yemen , after all, don't even get this far, starved not only of food but also the fuel needed just to reach medical help.

CNN watched overstretched doctors and nurses as they tried to give oxygen to Hassan, who had arrived six days earlier but wasn't putting on any weight, and was struggling to breathe. Just hours later, Hassan died.

""He is just one of many cases,"" said Dr. Osman Salah. The ward is full of children suffering from malnutrition, including babies just weeks old.

Ten-month-old Hassan Ali, who died in a hospital in Abs, Yemen, where he was being treated for malnutrition.

Every month, this hospital's pediatric ward takes in more patients than its capacity of 50, sometimes twice as many. Around 12 children die there each month, Salah said. He and his staff are running on empty -- they haven't been paid for more than half a year.

An estimated 47,000 people are likely to be living with ""catastrophic"" levels of food insecurity -- or famine-like conditions -- according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the world's authority on food security. A further 16 million are living in either ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food security conditions, the analysis shows. That's more than half of Yemen's population.

The rapidly deteriorating situation is the result mostly of funding cuts that have battered activities by agencies like the World Food Programme, which is struggling now to meet the most basic of needs for millions of Yemenis, particularly in the country's north.

But it has also been exacerbated by a mounting fuel crisis. Staff at the hospital in Abs, where baby Hassan lost his life, say they will have to shut in less than three weeks if they don't receive more funding and fuel to keep their generators going. It's the same story all over the north.

""If fuel were easily available on the market, the number of cases we are seeing in the hospital would be much higher, because at the moment, there are patients who are staying at home, because of the challenges and expenses of traveling to the hospital,"" Dr. Salah said.

As a result, said Dr. Salah, children are simply dying in their homes.

A bitter blockade

Fuel typically comes into the country's north via the port of Hodeidah, usually bustling with economic activity at the best of times. Even during Yemen's ongoing civil war, it has been a lively gateway for the conflict economy, where food and other aid that Yemenis rely on arrive.

But the port is now a ghost town. Hundreds of food aid trucks sit parked in a line stretching for miles along a dusty road. A cavernous tank that usually stores some 2,500 metric tons of oil sits empty at the port. It lets off an echoey clang with the softest touch.

Trucks lined up on a road outside Hodeidah, fully laden but with no fuel to leave.

Saudi warships have not allowed any oil tankers to berth at Hodeidah since the start of the year, the Houthis say, an assertion backed by the World Food Programme. The practice is starving the north of much-needed fuel. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has been militarily supporting the internationally recognized Yemeni government, which is now operating in exile from Riyadh.

The Saudi vessels that patrol the waters of Hodeidah have control over which commercial ships can dock and unload their cargo. Some goods are getting through -- CNN witnessed aid being loaded on to trucks at the port after being delivered by ship -- but not any fuel to deliver them.

CNN obtained documents from the port's arrival log showing that 14 vessels had been cleared by the UN's verification and inspection body to carry fuel to the country. The tracking website MarineTraffic.com shows those vessels are now sitting in the Red Sea between the Saudi-Yemen border and Eritrea, unable to unload their fuel.

The UN has previously accused the Houthis of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel taxes earmarked to pay civil servants. Nonetheless, the UN has reiterated that agencies still need to operate in the north, where the need is greatest.

The port of Hodeidah's fuel storage facility, running dry. The last shipment of oil arrived on December 30 last year.

Houthi officials tell CNN that they are being fined millions of dollars by the companies that own the ships while they are unable to dock.

Nearly three years ago the UN Security Council criminalized ""intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare,"" and demanded that ""access to supplies that are necessary for food preparation, including water and fuel"" be kept intact in northern Yemen.

The Saudi government did not reply to CNN's request for comment on the new fuel blockade and a question on whether blocking fuel might constitute a method of warfare.

The World Health Organization, which provides critical funding to hospitals and clinics, says it has been left with no funding at all to secure fuel to carry out its services across Yemen.

""From March 2021, WHO will have to stop distributing fuel to 206 facilities across the country, over 60 percent are hospitals providing services not available at the already fragile primary level. This will lead to the stoppage of life-saving services, such as emergency rooms and intensive care units, including COVID-19 ICUs. Over 9 million people will be affected,"" it said in a document, shared with CNN.

The Saudi-backed Yemeni government has repeatedly denied CNN visas to enter the country's north after coverage last year that exposed Saudi Arabia's dramatic drop in humanitarian funding for the war. CNN traveled at night by boat from east Africa to reach the Houthi-controlled north, where a Saudi blockade has contributed to widescale suffering and enormous food security challenges.

Saudi Arabia has been targeting Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen since 2015, with the support of the US and other Western allies. It had hoped to stem the Houthis' spread of power and influence in the country by backing the internationally-recognized government under President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi.

The Houthis continue to hit Saudi targets with missiles from within Yemen and drone attacks.

Can Biden turn the war?

The dynamics of the conflict, however, appear to be rapidly changing. In February, US President Joe Biden announced a new Yemen strategy, giving momentum to the search for a ceasefire and eventual political solution.

There are few concrete details yet of his policy, but central to his announcement was the US' withdrawal of offensive support for Saudi Arabia.

""The US historically has not viewed Yemen as an independent sovereign nation in its own right. The US has treated Yemen as an extension of either the US-Saudi policy or the US-Iranian crisis,"" said Munir Saeed, former president of a Yemeni pro-democracy group TAWQ, at a Yemen briefing held by Fair Observer last week.

He welcomed the change in direction, saying the Biden strategy was the first from the US to put Yemen's interests at its center.

""Dealing with Yemen as a country by itself that has its own problems, and cutting it away from the problems of Saudi-Iranian problems ... is very important to lead to peace.""

The Obama administration was supportive of Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen in 2015 and offered the Kingdom arms deals worth more than $115 billion total, more than any other US administration in the history of US-Saudi relations, according to a report by the Center for International Policy.

It later imposed restrictions on the sale of certain arms to Riyadh, including precision-guided munitions, after reports of civilian casualties in several Saudi-led airstrikes. The Trump administration reversed some of those restrictions, though he faced constant challenges in Congress.

As part of his new approach, Biden also appointed a special envoy for Yemen, Tim Lenderking, who is wrapping up a two-week visit to region, trying to engage different parties and give mediation efforts a reboot.

There will be limitations to how much the Biden administration can achieve, and ultimately, a ceasefire will depend on Yemeni actors on the ground.

And the Houthis are showing little appetite of slowing down, still launching missiles and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, which has been responding with airstrikes. The Houthis said last week they had also seized control of 10 out of 14 districts of the strategic northern city of Marib

On the back of his Gulf trip, Lenderking told CNN that Saudi Arabia and its allied Yemeni government were ready to agree to a ceasefire, and called on the Houthis to end their cross-border strikes and assault on Marib.

""They are ready to sit down to negotiate an end to the conflict with all relevant parties, including Ansarallah, sometimes referred to as the Houthis, during which access to ports and other issues could be addressed and resolved quickly,"" he said, using the group's formal name, in an emailed response to CNN's questions.

When asked about US support for Saudi Arabia while the country was blocking fuel deliveries to Hodeidah, Lenderking said the situation was ""complex.""

""On fuel, we need to be clear where the problem lies,"" he said, pointing to a UN accusation against the Houthis that they had siphoned fuel taxes earmarked to pay Yemeni civil servants to fund its war effort as the main reason the fuel tankers have been barred from docking.

""Instead, Ansarallah diverted them to their war effort, which they continue to fund with revenues from diverted imports and port revenues.""

The old city of the capital, Sana'a. Houthi rebels control Sana'a after forcing the internationally recognized government out.

Lenderking said the US was urging the Yemeni government to work with the UN around the impasse to ensure that aid continues to flow where it's needed and that a fuel shortage doesn't worsen the situation.

In Yemen, CNN met with Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi, a senior Houthi leader, who said his group was willing to come to the negotiating table but wanted to see more action from the US first before it put trust in Biden.

""First of all, President Biden was a partner of President Obama, and during that time they declared that they would join the coalition against our country. They also agreed about and gave the green light for the coalition to continue perpetuating the killing in our country,"" he said.

""Trust is created by actions not words. Trust must come about by decisions. So far, we have not seen any concrete decisions being made.""

Aid agency's plead for action now

A political solution, or at least an initial ceasefire, would go a long way in addressing the country's food security problems.

""Ultimately, until there's an end to the war, we are doing what we can to save lives. But Yemen needs peace,"" said the World Food Programme's Yemen spokesperson Annabel Symington.

In April last year, the WFP said it was forced to cut every second monthly food aid delivery to 8 million people in Yemen's north. It's now hoping to raise $1.9 billion, which will be enough just to avert widescale famine.

Mohammed, a severely malnourished 6-month old, at the Therapeutic Centre in Abs Hospital.

The WFP and most agencies don't know how much money they will get this year, but it isn't looking good. A pledging conference on March 1 garnered less than half the $3.85 billion the UN estimates it needs just to keep the country fed and running.

Philippe Duamelle, the Yemen representative for UNICEF, is making an urgent plea for donors to step up their pledges, warning that 2.3 million children under the age of 5 in Yemen are projected to suffer acute malnutrition this year, up 16% from 2020.

""The children of Yemen cannot wait, we've got to be able to assist them and save them now. The situation has deteriorated significantly, and we need to reverse the trends now,"" he said.

But in all humanitarian disasters, there are glimmers of hope. In the district of Harf Soufian, which in January descended into the ""catastrophic"" famine-like category, another 10-month old baby, just like Hassan Ali, has been fighting for her life.

Zahra sat in her mother's arms, sucking her fingers, at the Rural Harf Soufian Hospital. All the staff here have been excited by her success story.

Ten-month-old Zahra sits in her mother's arms at the Rural Harf Soufian Hospital, where she has become a celebrated success story.

When she came to the hospital, her doctor said, she weighed just 5 kilograms, putting her in the bottom 5% for girls by weight, according to WHO growth standards. In just four days, she has put on 400 grams, no mean feat for a baby from a district starved of food.

""She is improving,"" said Dr. Adnan Abdul-Rahman, looking through a log of her weight gain.

""The hard thing is getting the children here. But when families can get them here, it makes a difference."""
